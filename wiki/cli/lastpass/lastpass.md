# LastPass | Password Management

### The Problem with LastPass

There is only one downside to LastPass - cloud storage. Many naively ask LastPass to add a **local storage** option - if they did this they would cease to exist in their current form.

LastPass | Major Features

Once you accept that your credentials will be stored in the cloud - LastPass offers an unparalled set of features including

- integration with every major browser for website passwords
- a mobile (Android/iOS) app for managing app passwords
- usable on all key platforms including Windows, Linux and MacOS
- built in command line and scripting support (lastpass cli)
- sharing passwords amongst a team including hierarchical groups
- a massive range of export and import options
- export to plaintext CSV allowing you to backup using blunt tools
