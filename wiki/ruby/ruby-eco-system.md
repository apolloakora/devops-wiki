# Ruby Eco System | Undisputed Ruby Tools

To produce quality Ruby software, you need to engage with Ruby's eco-system of indefatigable tools.

## Ruby Gem | https://rubygems.org

A Ruby Gem is the core package unit that can either be called or extended. All public gems live at RubyGems.org and it pays to deploy as much of your Ruby code there as is possible (without jeopardising your usp (unique selling point).

## Ruby's Eco System for Gem Development

To create and deploy your own Ruby gem, follow the below guides.

- RVM | Use RVM to install Ruby and Create a Gem Set
- Rake | Use Rake to build, test, install and release to RubyGems.org
- Bundler | Use Bundler for a segregated gem environment that leaves system gems untouched
- Cucumber or Minitest | Use Minitest to execute a batch of gem unit tests
- Aruba | Use (Cucumber's) Aruba for system testing from the **command line** (cli)
- Yard | Use Yard to read and serve appealing and navigable code documentation
- Thor | Use Thor to create a modern intuitive cli (command line interface)

The above are the undisputed leaders in their respective fields. However that is now, back then others heavyweights ruled the roost.
