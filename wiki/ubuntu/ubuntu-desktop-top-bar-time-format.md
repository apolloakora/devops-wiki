Adding the date to the time format on the top bar in Ubuntu 17.10 and 18.04 is a must if you keep forgetting what the day and date are.

## Steps to change the top bar time format in Ubuntu client

First you install the **gnome configuration tweak tool**.

``` bash
sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool --assume-yes  # install gnome config tweak tool
```
