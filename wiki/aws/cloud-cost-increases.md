# Cost is a Risk!

Almost all tech startups are adopting a serverless paradigm in the hope of remaining fleet of foot without getting bogged down in activities that do not directly deliver business value.

This trend is evident in the take-up of

a serverless managed Kubernetes service like Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
a serverless managed database service like Amazon's Aurora (MySQL and Postgres)
a serverless managed queue service like Amazon's ActiveMQ product
a serverless managed logging service like AWS ElasticSearch
The list goes on with email, lambda software, VPN and is endless.

## What is the cost risk?

AWS adds a premium of between 25% and 30% on top of the underlying EC2 cost of the servers for managing these services.

An increase to 50% once businesses have no backward path or skills is the risk.
