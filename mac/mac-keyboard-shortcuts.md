## Mac App Switching with Command Tab

Minimized applications do not switch nicely with Command Tab. The icons are visible but on release the window is not opened. The only way to un-minimize an app is with a mouse click.

The two solutions are
- **`killall Dock`** # perform this on the command line (terminal or emacs)
- use the mouse to un-minimize the app first
