# Ruby Command Line | 3 Things

A cutting edge app that has a (Ruby) command line interface needs 3 things

- to be called directly by name (not ruby something.rb ...)
- to deliver familiar command switches and help pages
- to be tested from the command line interface itself.

The answers to these 3 questions are

- ruby gems built, installed, tested and released by rake to rubygems.org
- either OptionParser or Thor for a powerful intuitive command interface
- the Ruby Cucumber test framework using Aruba for command line testing

For Ruby (DevOps) developers - the command line is the most important interface. Even more so than the Ruby on Rails UI which is why you need to invest in using **Ruby's command line eco-system best-of-breed**.
