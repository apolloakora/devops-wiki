# Devops Wiki | for Devops Engineers

It is vital to carry expert know-how to the key Devops technologies namely Docker, Kubernetes, Git, AWS, Jenkins, Python, Ruby, Ansible and Bash.

## The Primary Devops Technologies

- Docker - the Docker CLI and Dockerhub
- Kubernetes Objects, Kops and the kubectl CLI
- Terraform
- Git - version management and GitHub, Hub and Gitlab
- AWS Console and the AWS Cli
- Jenkins
- Ansible | Chef and Puppet for configuration management

## The Key Devops Software Technologies

- Python
- Ruby
- Bash
- Go

## Editors for the Devops Engineer

Nothing boosts productivity like a deep knowledge of editors and interfaces and the ability to navigate them in order to create, understand and command.

- the PyCharm (IntelliJ) Python Editor
- the Emacs Operating Environment
- the RubyMine Ruby IDE
- the Firefox web browsing interface

## Core Binding Technologies

- networks
- http | https | dns
- VPNs - OpenVPN

## Operating Environments

- Ubuntu
- Mac
- CoreOS

## Key Application Services

- Queues like RabbitMQ and Kafka
- Relational Databases like Postgres | Mysql | Oracle
- NoSQL Databases like ElasticSearch | MongoDB
- Security Infrastructure like Vault

## Pipelines Orchestration and Services

- Jenkins | Bamboo | CodeShip | TravisCI and Circle CI

## Pipelines | Jenkins | SonarQube | Nexus

How do you create an entire **Continous Integration Pipeline** in one step using **[docker compose](/pipeline/pipeline-using-docker-compose)**? How do you use **[Kubernetes PaaS to run your Jenkins Build Jobs](/kubernetes/kubernetes-slaves)**? How do you setup a **[declarative Jenkinsfile for a JAVA microservice](/pipeline/for-java-microservice/)**? What about a **[.NET microservice](/pipeline/for-dotnet-microservice/)**?

## [Use Kubernetes to run Jenkins Jobs](/kubernetes/kubernetes-slaves)

The benefits of running your Jenkins slaves (workers/builds) in Kubernetes are

- the Jenkins master and UI **never gets overburdened** hence rarely fails
- you can run a complex Jenkins workload locally against branches
- a different team can manage the Kubernetes stack implementing **platform as a service**
- you can use multi-tenancy to run pipelines and app environments in the same cluster
- you can **scale Jenkins horizontally** as well as vertically
