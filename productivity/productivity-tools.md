- ***consume (eat) our own documentation portals and resources***
- save bookmarks, perform research, find solutions to technial problems
- **interface with cloud services like AWS, Google Analytics and more**
- download applications and pre-engineered archetypal solutions
- ***monitor using DataDog, kanban boards and dashboards like Kibana***

Password managers and other plugins help us maintain high authentication standards without lowering our productivity profiles.

- Slack
- BitBucket
- Jira
- Confluence
- Google Docs
- Google Drive
- Google Gmail

## Mozilla Firefox | Ubuntu 1804

On Ubuntu 18.04 Mozilla Firefox comes as standard and is the preferred productivity tool for interfacing with the web page based internet.

## Mozilla Firefox | Importing and Exporting Bookmarks


## Mozilla Firefox | Installing Certificates


## Mozilla Firefox | Launching Apps

To launch an app we need to set and encrypt its configuration. Once that's done we run a command which will launch the browser in the foreground, access the configured page and send the appropriate keys.


Productivity tools are one on one unlike team collaboration tools like Jira, Git, Confluence and Slack which are account based and facilitate team working and communication.
