# Terraform Code Smells

Is your Terraform code base giving off a number of "smells" (term popularized by Martin Fowler)?

**You need to ask yourself**

- can I recognise the key **Terraform "smells"**?
- do I know **why they arise** (the root cause)?
- am I able to refactor my Terraform code?


**Most Terraform code bases I encountered were giving off these very common smells.**

This didn't matter for the smaller code bases and the single person teams. However, as the lines of Terraform began to rise - these smells became significant inhibitors - to the point of being quite unpleasant for those working in and around the code.
