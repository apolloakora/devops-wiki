# Counting Matchsticks

An architect is going to make a cuboid wireframe model ( modelling prison cells ).

## The 1 x 2 x 1 Model

***20 matchsticks*** are used to make the 1 x 2 model.

Remember x x y x z = x is near/far from your chest y is left or right z is up or down


## The 2 &times; 3 etc Models

How many matchsticks are needed for the

- 2 x 3 x 1
- 3 x 4 x 1
- 4 x 5 x 1

models.

## The n by (n+1) by 1 Model

How many matchsticks are needed for the n x (n+1) x 1 model?


## Structural Counting (the Genius Method)

Each model contains 2 groups of matchsticks

- matchsticks from the previous model
- extra matchsticks from this model

Use number patterns to derive the formula for the number of matchsticks in the "Previous Model".
Is there a genius way (structural counting).

Use structural counting to derive a formula for the extra matchsticks.


Add your two formulae (previous and extra) matchsticks.

Is the answer what you expected?
