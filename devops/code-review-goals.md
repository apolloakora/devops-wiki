# Code Review (Pull Request) Goals

What goals are you trying to achieve when you (an experience developer) take the time to talk through code produced by another (possibly experienced) developer.

You want to perform a code review in order to

- **measurably increase** the project's **code quality**
- grow the developer as an engineer and an architect
- grow domain understanding for both parties
- act as a catalyst for achieving individual, project, team and business goals


Okay, so how exactly can **a (your) code review** deliver this.
