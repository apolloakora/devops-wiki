# Install AWS Command Line Interface (awscli)

```
pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
# Now LOGOUT completely.
aws --version
```

Now LOGOUT completely in order for the aws to be placed on your path.

Once done you need to setup your profiles or use aws configure.
Better to setup profile in .aws/config
