# Finder Keyboard Shortcuts | Mac OSX

The Finder is the central app on the mac for navigating the file tree. As such it is crucial that all IT professionals can execute multiple use cases at speed - and to achieve that you need to know the keyboard shortcuts.

## Goto Folder Shortcuts | Command Shift

You go to some folders (like Downloads) way more than most. Aptly there are shortcuts for getting to these frequent flier destinations.

- **`Command Option L`** - goto **Downloads**
- **`Command Shift C`** - go to the disk root folders
- **`Command Shift H`** - goto **Home**
- **`Command Shift D`** - goto **Desktop**
- **`Command Shift O`** - goto **Documents**
- **`Command Shift I`** - goto **iCloud Drive**
- **`Command Shift F`** - goto **Recent Files**
- **`Command Shift G`** - opens a dialog for you to type in the file or folder path

Note that **`Command Option L`** for Downloads is the exception - the rest use **`Command Shift`**.


## Navigation Shortcuts

Navigating around your files and folders is the primary Finder use case. The keyboard shortcuts are

- **`Command Up Arrow`** - move **up** to the parent folder
- **`Command Down Arrow`** - drill **down** into the folder
- **`Command o`** - drill **down** into a folder or open the file or run the program
- **`Left and Right Arrow`** - these enable you to move the focus along files and folders in the current view

## Finder Editing Shortcuts

When you don't want to stick with the status quo - you'll need to make changes. The keyboard shortcuts are

- **`Command Shift N`** - create a new folder
- **`Command Enter`** - rename a folder
- **`Command Delete`** - delete selected files/folders (move them to the recycle bin)


## Switch to the 4 Finder Views | Command <N>

Finder has four powerful ways to view files and folders.

1. **Icon View** - **`Command 1`** switches to the **icon** view
1. **List View** - **`Command 2`** switches to the **list** view
1. **Column View** - **`Command 3`** switches to the **column** view
1. **Gallery View** - **`Command 4`** switches to the **gallery (preview)** view

To view more information about a file or folder you can use **`Command i`** and a card will popup with the **info**.

## Grouping your Icons and Lists | Command Control <N>

Use **`Command Control 1`** to tidy up your view. If new files and folders are messily placed or if there are holes from deletions use **`Cmd Ctrl 1`** to restore sanity.

Also use Command Control to view your files in groups when using the **icon** and **list** views.

1. **Document Type** - use **`Command Control 2`** to place  the folders first then the document type groups.
1. **Date Last Opened, Added, Modified** use **`Command Control 3 or 4 or 5`** to group by the date added
1. **File Size** use **`Command Control 6`** to group by the size

Grouping by size is really handy for understanding what is eating up your disk.

## Sorting Icons and Lists within Groups | Command Option Control <N>

Holding down the 3 buttons and pressing a number is not as hard as it sounds. It enables you to sub sort within the groups you specified with the **`Command Control`** keys.

1. **Alphabetically by Name** use **`Command Option Control 1`**
1. **By File Type** use **`Command Option Control 2`**
1. **By Date Last Opened** use **`Command Option Control 3`**
1. **By Date Added** use **`Command Option Control 4`**
1. **By Date Modified** use **`Command Option Control 5`**
1. **By File Size** use **`Command Option Control 6`**

## Viewing Hidden Files | Command Shift Period

Command Shift and Dot toggles viewing the hidden files within the folder's portfolio.


## Finder Settings | Command Comma | Command j

As with most MacOsx apps, **`Command ,`** opens up the settings dialog. With finder you can set the default home folder.

### Configuring Finder Views | Command j

Use **`Command j`** to get into the view configuration to set and decide

- which columns you want to see (within the list view)?
- whether you want folder tree sizes calculated?
- what default grouping (and sorting within the group) would you like?
- whether you want to default to an icon or a list view?
- whether you want every folder view to use the above defaults
